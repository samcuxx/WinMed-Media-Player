## Installation

### Option 1: Using the Installer (Windows)

1.  Download the latest `WinMed-Setup-X.X.X.exe` from the [Releases](https://github.com/samcuxx/WinMed-Media-Player/releases) page (if available).
2.  Run the downloaded installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
3.  During installation, you can choose to associate WinMed with common media file types.

### Option 2: Running from Source

1.  Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/samcuxx/WinMed-Media-Player.git
cd WinMed-Media-Player
```

2.  Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3.  Start the application:

```bash
npm start
```

### Registering as a Media Player in Windows

To register WinMed as a media player and associate it with media file types:

1.  First, package the application:

```bash
npm run package:win
```

2.  Then register the file associations:

```bash
npm run register-filetypes
```

This will register WinMed with Windows as a media player application and add it to the "Open with" menu for supported file types. You can then set it as the default application for specific media formats through Windows Settings.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher recommended)
- npm (v6 or higher recommended)
- [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) (v6 or higher recommended, required for creating the Windows installer)

### Building from Source

1.  Clone the repository and navigate into the directory.
2.  Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3.  To package the application (without creating an installer):

```bash
# For Windows
npm run package:win
# (Add similar scripts for macOS/Linux if needed)
```

    This will create a packaged version of the app in the `release-builds` directory.

4.  To create the Windows installer (requires Inno Setup to be installed and configured):

```bash
npm run create-installer:win
```

    This will first run the `package:win` script and then use Inno Setup to create an installer in the `installers` directory.

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

## Supported Formats

- Video: MP4, WebM
- Audio: MP3, WAV, OGG
- Subtitles: SRT (converted to VTT internally)
